## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java application server with Freemarker support (e.g., Spring Boot, Servlet container)
- Modern web browser
- Basic understanding of Freemarker templates

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-directory
   ```

2. **Set up Freemarker environment**
   - Ensure your server can process `.ftlh` templates
   - Configure static resource serving for `/static/` path
   - Set up template data passing (employees, departments, roles)

3. **Configure data passing**
   In your server-side code, pass the following data to the template:
   ```java
   // Example data structure for Freemarker
   model.addAttribute("employees", employeeList);
   model.addAttribute("departments", uniqueDepartments);
   model.addAttribute("roles", uniqueRoles);
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   - Start your Java server
   - Navigate to the dashboard endpoint
   - The application will load with pre-populated employee data

### Alternative Setup (Static Files)
For demonstration purposes, you can also run this as static files:
1. Convert the `.ftlh` file to `.html`
2. Replace Freemarker variables with static data
3. Open `dashboard.html` in a modern web browser

## üéØ Assignment Reflection

### Challenges Faced

1. **Complex State Management**: Managing interdependent filters, search, and pagination required careful coordination to ensure all features work together seamlessly.

2. **Responsive Design**: Creating a truly responsive interface that works well on all device sizes while maintaining functionality was challenging, especially for complex components like the employee grid and forms.

3. **Form Validation**: Implementing comprehensive validation with good UX required balancing immediate feedback with user experience, ensuring users aren't overwhelmed with error messages.

4. **Freemarker Integration**: Properly structuring the template to work with server-side data while maintaining client-side interactivity required careful planning.

### Technical Decisions

1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chose pure JavaScript over frameworks to demonstrate fundamental DOM manipulation skills and keep the project lightweight.

2. **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Used modern CSS layout techniques for responsive design instead of CSS frameworks to show custom styling capabilities.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns between data management, application logic, and presentation for better maintainability.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built the application to work with server-rendered content and enhance it with JavaScript functionality.

### What I Learned

- Advanced JavaScript patterns for managing complex application state
- Effective strategies for creating responsive, mobile-first designs
- Best practices for form validation and user experience
- Proper integration of server-side templates with client-side functionality
- Performance optimization techniques for DOM manipulation

### Areas for Improvement

Given more time, I would focus on:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets and optimize DOM operations
2. **Accessibility**: Add comprehensive ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for JavaScript functions and integration tests for user workflows
4. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Data Persistence**: Add localStorage fallback for better user experience
6. **Advanced Features**: Implement drag-and-drop sorting, bulk operations, and export functional.
